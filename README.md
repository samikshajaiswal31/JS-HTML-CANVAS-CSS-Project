# Title : Snake Game Project

* Built a game where the player controls a long, thin creature, resembling a snake, which roams around on a grid, picking up food, trying to avoid hitting its own tail    or the edges of the playing area.
* Feature: Each time the snake eats a piece of food, its tail grows longer for this simple unshift and pop logic used on an array, which seems like a snake is moving.
* Tech Stack-HTML, CSS, JavaScript and CANVAS
